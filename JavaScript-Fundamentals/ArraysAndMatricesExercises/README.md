## 1.Print an Array with a given Delimiter

Write a JS function that prints a given array.

The **input** comes as array of strings. The last element of the array is the delimiter.

The **output** is the same array, printed on the console, each element **separated** from the others by the **given delimiter**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |  
| --- | --- | 
| One <br/> Two <br/> Three <br/> Four <br/> Five- | One-Two-Three-Four-Five |   
| How about no? <br/> I <br/> will <br/> not <br/> do <br/> it! <br/> \_ | How about no?\_I\_will\_not\_do\_it! |

### Hints

- Let&#39;s start by extracting the delimiter from the input array:

```JavaScript
function main (input){
	let delimeter = input[input.length - 1];
}
```

- Now that we have the element, we need to delete it from the array, because we don&#39;t need it in the output. Thankfully, the Array in JavaScript has a **built-in function** for **removing the last element** , which is **Array.pop()**.

 ```JavaScript
function main (input){
	let delimeter = input[input.length - 1];
	input.pop();
}
```

- And last but not least, let&#39;s print each element of the array, separated with the next one by the delimiter:

 ```JavaScript
let result = "";

for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
	if(i == 0){
		result += input[i];
	}else {
		result += delimeter + input[i];
	}
}

console.log(result);
```

- The **result** variable holds our final string. The **if** check in the loop is necessary so that we don&#39;t **attach an**** unneeded delimiter** somewhere in the result string.

## 2.Print every N-th Element from an Array

Write a JS function that prints every element of an array, on a given step.

The **input** comes as array of strings. The last element is **N - the step**.

The **output** is every element on the **N-th** step **starting from the first one**. If the step is &quot; **3**&quot;, you need to print the **1-st** , the **4-th** , the **7-th** â€¦ and so on, until you reach the end of the array. The elements must be printed each on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- |
| 5 <br/> 20 <br/> 31 <br/> 4 <br/> 20 <br/> 2 | 5 <br/> 31 <br/> 20 |   
| dsa <br/> asd <br/> test <br/> tset <br/> 2  | dsa <br/> test |
| 1 <br/> 2 <br/> 3 <br/> 4 <br/> 5 <br/> 6 | 1 |

### Hints

- Use what you&#39;ve seen from the **previous problem** to **extract the last element** of the array.
- Create a **step** variable to hold the **given step** of the array. Then **print all the elements** with a **for** loop, **incrementing** the **loop variable** with the value of the **step** variable.

## 3.\*Add and Remove Elements from Array

Write a JS function that **adds** and **removes** numbers **to / from** an array. You will receive a command which can either be &quot; **add**&quot; or &quot; **remove**&quot;.

The **initial number** is **1**. Each input command should **increase that number** , regardless of what it is.

Upon receiving an &quot; **add**&quot; command you should add the current number to your array.
Upon receiving the &quot; **remove**&quot; command you should remove the last entered number, currently existent in the array.

The **input** comes as array of strings. Each element holds a **command**.

The **output** is the array itself, with each element printed on a new line. In case of an empty array, just print &quot; **Empty**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |  
| --- | --- |
| add <br/> add <br/> add <br/> add  | 1 <br/> 2 <br/> 3 <br/> 4 |   
| add <br/> add <br/> remove <br/> add <br/> add | 1 <br/> 4 <br/> 5 | 
|remove <br/> remove <br/> remove | Empty |

## 4.Rotate Array

Write a JS function that rotates an array. The array should be rotated to the right side, meaning that the last element should become the first, upon rotation.

The **input** comes as array of strings. The **last element** of the array is the amount of rotation you need to perform.

The **output** is the resulted array after the rotations. The elements should be printed on one line, separated by a **single space**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   
| --- | --- |
| 1 <br/> 2 <br/> 3 <br/> 4 <br/> 2 | 3 4 1 2 |   
| Banana <br/> Orange <br/> Coconut <br/> Apple <br/> 15 | Orange Coconut Apple Banana |

### Hints

- Check if there is a **built-in function** for inserting elements **at the**** start** of the array.

## 5.Extract an Non-decreasing Subsequence from an Array

Write a JS function that extracts only those numbers that **form a**** non-decreasing subsequence **. In other words, you start from the** first element **and continue to** the end **of the** given array of numbers **. Any number which is** LESS THAN **the** current biggest one **is** ignored **, alternatively if it&#39;s equal or higher than the** current biggest one **you set it as the** current biggest one** and you continue to the next number.

The **input** comes as array of strings. Each element will represent a number.

The **output** is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subsequence. Each element should be printed on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |  
| --- | --- |
| 1 <br/> 3 <br/> 8 <br/> 4 <br/> 10 <br/> 12 <br/> 3 <br/> 2 <br/> 24 | 1 <br/> 3 <br/> 8 <br/> 10 <br/> 12 <br/> 24 | 
| 1 <br/> 2 <br/> 3 <br/> 4 | 1 <br/> 2 <br/> 3 <br/> 4 | 
|20 <br/> 3 <br/> 2 <br/> 15 <br/> 6 <br/> 1 | 20 |

### Hints

- The **Array.filter()** built-in function might help you a lot with this problem.

## 6.Sort an Array by 2 Criteria

Write a JS function that orders a **given array of strings** , by **length** in **ascending order** as **primary criteria** , and by **alphabetical value** in **ascending order** as **second criteria**. The comparison should be **case-insensitive**.

The **input** comes as array of strings.

The **output** is the ordered array of strings.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |  
| --- | --- |
| alpha <br/> beta <br/> gamma | beta <br/> alpha <br/> gamma |   
| Isacc <br/> Theodor <br/> Jack <br/> Harrison <br/> George  | Jack <br/> Isacc <br/> George <br/> Theodor <br/> Harrison  |
| test <br/> Deny <br/> omen <br/> Default | Deny <br/> omen <br/> test <br/> Default |

### Hints

- An array can be sorted by passing a comparing function to the **Array.sort()** function.
- Creating a comparing function by 2 criteria can be achieved by first comparing by the **main criteria** , if the 2 items are different (the result of the compare is not 0) - return the result as the result of the comparing function. If the two items are the same by the **main criteria** (the result of the compare is 0), we need to compare by the **second criteria** and the result of that comparison is the result of the comparing function.

# 2.Multidimensional Arrays

We will mainly work with 2-dimensional arrays. The concept is as simple as working with a simple 1-dimensional array. It is just an array of arrays.

## 7.Magic Matrices

Write a JS function that checks if a given matrix of numbers is magical. A matrix is magical if the **sums of the cells** of **every row** and **every column** are **equal**.

The **input** comes as array of strings. Each element represents a **string of numbers** , with **spaces** between them. Parse it into a **matrix of numbers** , so you can work with it. The input numbers will **always be positive**.

The **output** is a Boolean result indicating whether the matrix is magical or not.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |  
| --- | --- | 
| [&#39;4 5 6&#39;,  &#39;6 5 4&#39;,  &#39;5 5 5&#39;] | true |   
| [&#39;11 32 45&#39;  ,&#39;21 0 1&#39; ,&#39;21 1 1&#39;] | false  |
| [&#39;1 0 0&#39; ,&#39;0 0 1&#39; ,&#39;0 1 0&#39;] | true |

## 8.\*Spiral Matrix

Write a JS function that generates a **Spirally-filled** matrix with numbers, with given dimensions.

The **input** comes as array of strings. There will be exactly **one element** , containing the **dimensions of the matrix** , which will be **2 numbers** separated by a **space**.

The **output** is the matrix filled spirally starting from **1**. You need to print **every row on a new line** , with the cells **separated by a space**. Check the examples below.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | 
| 5 5 | 1 2 3 4 5 <br/> 16 17 18 19 6 <br/> 15 24 25 20 7 <br/> 14 23 22 21 8 <br/> 13 12 11 10 9 |   
| 3 3 | 1 2 3 <br/> 8 9 4 <br/> 7 6 5 |

## 9.\*Diagonal Attack

Write a JS function that reads a given matrix of numbers, and checks if both **main diagonals have equal sum**. If they do, set every element that is **NOT** part of **the main diagonals** to that sum, alternatively just print the matrix unchanged.

The **input** comes as array of strings. Each element represents a **string of numbers** , with **spaces** between them. Parse it into a **matrix of numbers** , so you can work with it.

The **output** is either the new matrix, with all cells not belonging to a main diagonal changed to the diagonal sum or the original matrix, if the two diagonals have different sums. You need to print **every row on a new line** , with cells **separated by a space**. Check the examples below.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   
| --- | --- | 
| [&#39;5 3 12 3 1&#39;,&#39;11 4 23 2 5&#39;,&#39;101 12 3 21 10&#39;,&#39;1 4 5 2 2&#39;,&#39;5 22 33 11 1&#39;] | 5 15 15 15 1 <br/> 15 4 15 2 15 <br/> 15 15 3 15 15 <br/> 15 4 15 2 15 <br/> 5 15 15 15 1 |   
| [&#39;1 1 1&#39;,&#39;1 1 1&#39;&#39;1 1 0&#39;]  | 1 1 1 <br/> 1 1 1 <br/> 1 1 0 |

## 10.\*\*Orbit

You will be given an empty rectangular space of cells. Then you will be given the position of a star. You need to build the orbits around it.

You will be given a coordinate of a cell, which will **always be**** inside the matrix **, on which you will put the value â€“** 1 **. Then you must set the values of the cells** directly surrounding that cell **, including the** diagonals **,** to **** 2**. After which you must set the values of the next surrounding cells to 3 and so on. Check the pictures for more info.

For example we are given a matrix which has 5 rows and 5 columns and the star is at coordinates â€“ &quot; **0 0**&quot;. Then the following should happen:

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |  
| --- | --- | 
| 4 4 <br/> 0 0 | 1 2 3 4 <br/> 2 2 3 4 <br/> 3 3 3 4 <br/> 4 4 4 4 |   
| 5 5 <br/> 2 2  | 3 3 3 3 3 <br/> 3 2 2 2 3 <br/> 3 2 1 2 3 <br/> 3 2 2 2 3 <br/> 3 3 3 3 3 | 
|3 3 <br/> 2 2 | 3 3 3 <br/> 3 2 2 <br/> 3 2 1 |

### Hints

- Check if there is some **dependency** or **relation** between the **position of the numbers** and the **rows** and **columns** of those positions.
