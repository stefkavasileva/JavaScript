## 1.Print Letters

Write a JS function that prints all the symbols of a string, each on a new line.

The **input** comes as array of one string element.

The **output** is printed on the console, each letter on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;Hello, World!&#39;] | str[0] -&gt; H <br/> str[1] -&gt; e <br/> str[2] -&gt; l <br/> str[3] -&gt; l <br/> str[4] -&gt; o <br/> str[5] -&gt; ,str[6] -&gt;   <br/> str[7] -&gt; W <br/> str[8] -&gt; o <br/> str[9] -&gt; r <br/> str[10] -&gt; l <br/> str[11] -&gt; d <br/> str[12] -&gt; ! |
| [&#39;SoftUni&#39;] | str[0] -&gt; S <br/> str[1] -&gt; o <br/> str[2] -&gt; f <br/> str[3] -&gt; t <br/> str[4] -&gt; U <br/> str[5] -&gt; n <br/> str[6] -&gt; i |

## 2.Concatenate Reversed

Write a JS function that reverses a series of strings and prints them concatenated from last to first.

The **input** comes as array of strings.

The **output** is printed on the console. Print all strings concatenated on a single line, starting from the last input string, going to the first. Reverse each individual string&#39;s letters.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;I&#39;, &#39;am&#39;, &#39;student&#39;] | tnedutsmaI |
| [&#39;race&#39;, &#39;car&#39;] | racecar |

## 3.Count Occurrences

Write a JS function that counts how many times a string occurs in a given text. Overlapping strings are allowed.

The **input** comes as array of two strings. The first element is the target string and the second element is the text in which to search for occurrences.

The **output** should be a number, printed on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;the&#39;, &#39;The quick brown fox jumps over the lay dog.&#39;] | 1 |
| [&#39;ma&#39;, &#39;Marine mammal training is the training and caring for marine life such as, dolphins, killer whales, sea lions, walruses, and other marine mammals. It is also a duty of the trainer to do mental and physical exercises to keep the animal healthy and happy.&#39;] | 7 |

## 4.Extract Text

You will be given a text as a string. Write a JS function that extracts and prints only the text that&#39;s surrounded by parentheses.

The **input** comes as array of a single string element.

The **output** is printed on the console on a single line, in the form of a comma-separated list.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;Rakiya (Bulgarian brandy) is self-made liquor (alcoholic drink)&#39;] | Bulgarian brandy, alcoholic drink |

## 5.Aggregate Table

You will be given a list of towns and incomes for each town, formatted in a table, separated by pipes (|). Write a JS function that extracts the names of all towns and produces a sum of the incomes. Note that splitting may result in empty string elements and the number of spaces may be different in every table.

The **input** comes as array of string elements. Each element is one row in a formatted table.

The **output** is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line, print a comma-separated list of all towns and on the second, the sum of all incomes.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;\| Sofia \| 300&#39;, &#39;\| Veliko Tarnovo  \| 500&#39;, &#39;\| Yambol \| 275&#39;] | Sofia, Veliko Tarnovo, Yambol1075 |

## 6.Restaurant Bill

You are tasked to write a JS function that receives an array of purchases and their prices and prints all your purchases and their total sum.

The **input** comes as an array of string elements – the elements on even indexes (0, 2, 4…) are the product names, while the elements on odd indexes (1, 3, 5…) are the corresponding prices.

The **output** should be printed on the console - a single sentence containing all products and their total sum in the format &quot; **You purchased {all products separated by comma + space} for a total sum of {total sum of products}**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;Beer Zagorka&#39;, &#39;2.65&#39;, &#39;Tripe soup&#39;, &#39;7.80&#39;,&#39;Lasagna&#39;, &#39;5.69&#39;] | You purchased Beer Zagorka, Tripe soup, Lasagna for a total sum of 16.14 |
| [&#39;Cola&#39;, &#39;1.35&#39;, &#39;Pancakes&#39;, &#39;2.88&#39;] | You purchased Cola, Pancakes for a total sum of 4.23 |

## 7.Usernames

Write a JS function that parses a list of emails and returns a list of usernames, generated from them. Each username is composed from the name of the email address, a period and the first letter of every element in the domain name. See the examples for more information.

The **input** comes as array of string elements. Each element is an email address.

The **output** is printed on the console on a single line as a comma-formatted list.

### Examples

| **Input** | **output**|
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;peshoo@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;todor\_43@mail.dir.bg&#39;, &#39;foo@bar.com&#39;] | peshoo.gc, todor\_43.mdb, foo.bc |

## 8.Censorship

The thought police are at it again and they need your help! Write a JS function that would **censor news articles**. You will be given a text and then a list of strings that need to be blacked out from the text. Replace all occurrences of the strings with dashes of the same length as the string. The strings will **not overlap** , so order of processing is not important. See the examples for more information.

The **input** comes as array of string elements. The first element is the text to be censored and all following elements are the strings to be censored.

The **output** is the return value of your functions. Save the censored results in a string and return it.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;roses are red, violets are blue&#39;, &#39; **, violets are**&#39;, &#39; **red**&#39;] | roses are ---------------- blue |
| [&#39;David Ruben Piqtoukun (born 1950) is an Inuit artist from Paulatuk, Northwest Territories. His output includes sculpture and prints; the sculptural work is innovative in its use of mixed media. His materials and imagery bring together modern and traditional Inuit stylistic elements in a personal vision. An example of this is his work &quot;The Passage of Time&quot; (1999), which portrays a shaman in the form of a salmon moving through a hole in a hand. While shamanic imagery is common in much of Inuit art, the hand in this work is sheet metal, not a traditional material such as walrus ivory, caribou antler or soapstone. Ruben\&#39;s brother, Abraham Apakark Anghik Ruben, is also a sculptor. Fellow Inuit artist Floyd Kuptana learned sculpting techniques as an apprentice to David Ruben.&#39;, &#39; **Inuit**&#39;] |  David Ruben Piqtoukun (born 1950) is an ----- artist from Paulatuk, Northwest Territories.

## 9.Escaping

You will be given a list of strings, containing user-submitted data. Write a JS function that prints an HTML list from the data. The strings, however, may contain special HTML characters, which is an oft-used method for injection attacks. To prevent unwanted behavior or harmful content, all special characters need to be replaced with their encoded counterparts – they will look the same to the user, but will not pose a security risk. Use the following table to compose your function:

| **Raw** | **Encoded** |
| --- | --- |
| &lt; | &amp;lt; |
| &gt; | &amp;gt; |
| &amp; | &amp;amp; |
| &quot; | &amp;quot; |

Use the provided HTML template to visually test your code – if you don&#39;t escape the control characters, formatted HTML will show up.Don&#39;t care how the HTML template works. Your job is to write the JS escaping function only.

The **input** comes as array of string elements.

The **output** is the return value of your function. Compose the list in a string and return it. See the examples for formatting details.

```HTML
 <!DOCTYPE **html** >
< **html**  **lang=****"en"**>
< **head** >
    < **meta**  **charset=****"UTF-8"**>
    < **title** >Escaping</ **title** >
</ **head** >
< **body** >
< **div** >< **label**  **for=****"userInput" **>Paste test input here:</** label **></** div**>
< **div** >
  < **textarea**  **rows=****"12" **** cols= ****"40"**  **id=****"userInput" **></** textarea**>
  < **input**  **type=****"button" **** value= ****"Escape"
       **** onclick= ****"**** document**.getElementById(**'result'**).**innerHTML**= html_Escape_(**JSON**.parse(**document**.getElementById(**'userInput'**).**value**.replace(/'/g, String.fromCharCode(34))));**"**/>
</ **div** >
< **div** >< **label**  **for=****"result" **>Results will show up here:</** label **></** div**>
< **div**  **id=****"result" **></** div**>
< **script** >
     **function html** _Escape_(input) {
        _//_ **TODO
    ** }
</ **script** >
</ **body** >
</ **html** > |
```

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;&lt;b&gt;unescaped text&lt;/b&gt;&#39;, &#39;normal text&#39;]| &lt;ul&gt; <br/>   &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;unescaped text&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt; <br/>   &lt;li&gt;normal text&lt;/li&gt; <br/> &lt;/ul&gt; |
| [&#39;&lt;div style=\&quot;color: red;\&quot;&gt;Hello, Red!&lt;/div&gt;&#39;, &#39;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cell 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cell 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&#39;] | &lt;ul&gt; <br/>   &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;div style=\&amp;quot;color: red;\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Hello, Red!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt; <br/>   &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Cell 1&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Cell 2&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt; <br/> &lt;/ul&gt; |

## 10.Match All Words

Write a JS function that matches all words in a text, a word is anything that consists of letters, numbers or underscores (\_).

The **input** comes as an array of string consisting of a single entry - the text from which to extract the words.

The **output** should be printed on the console and should consist of all words concatenated with a **&quot;|&quot;** (pipe), check the examples bellow to better understand the format.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;A Regular Expression needs to have the global flag in order to match all occurrences in the text&#39;] | A\|Regular\|Expression\|needs\|to\|have\|the\|global\|flag\|in\|order\|to\|match\|all\|occurrences\|in\|the\|text |
| [&#39;\_(Underscores) are also word characters&#39;] | \_\|Underscores\|are\|also\|word\|characters |

### Hints

- Read about the special characters in Regular Expressions at MDN to find some that can ease your task [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular\_Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

## 11.Simple Email Validation

Write a JS function that validates simple emails. The emails should have a **username** , which consists only of **English alphabet letters** and **digits** , **a &quot;@&quot; sign** , and a domain name after it. The domain should consist **only of**** 2 strings ****separated** by a **single dot**. The 2 strings should contain **NOTHING** but **lowercase English alphabet letters**.

The **input** comes as an array of strings. The array will hold one element which is an email.

The **output** should be printed on the console. If the given email is valid, print &quot; **Valid**&quot;, if it is not, print &quot; **Invalid**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| valid@email.bg | Valid |
| invalid@emai1.bg | Invalid |

## 12.\*Expression Split

Write a JS function that splits a passed in JS code into separate parts. The passed in code will always have one or more spaces between operators and operands. Normal brackets (**&#39;(&#39;**,**&#39;)&#39;**), commas ( **,** ), semicolons ( **;** ) and the member access operator (**&#39;.&#39;(dot)**, as in &quot;console **.** log&quot;) should also be used for splitting. String literals will always be initialized with double quotes (&quot;) and will **contain only letters**. Make sure there are no empty entries in the output.

The **input** comes as array of one string element - the JS code that has to be split.

The **output** should be printed on the console, with each elements obtained from the split is printed on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;let sum = 4 \* 4,b = &quot;wow&quot;;&#39;] | let <br/> sum <br/> = <br/> 4 <br/> \* <br/> 4 <br/> let <br/> b <br/> = <br/> &quot;wow&quot; |
| [&#39;let sum = 1 + 2;if(sum &gt; 2){\tconsole.log(sum);}&#39;] | let <br/> sum <br/> = <br/> 1 <br/> +2 <br/> if <br/> sum <br/> &gt; <br/> 2 <br/> { <br/> console <br/> log <br/> sum <br/> } |

## 13.Match the Dates

Write a JS function that finds and extracts all the dates in the given sentences. The dates should be in format
**d-MMM-yyyy**. **Example: 12-Jun-1999** , **3-Dec-2017**.

The **input** comes as an array of strings. Each string represents a sentence.

The **output** should be printed on the console. The output should consist of all extracted **VALID** dates. Each element should be printed on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| I am born on 30-Dec-1994. <br/> This is not date: 512-Jan-1996. <br/> My father is born on the 29-Jul-1955. | 30-Dec-1994 (Day: 30, Month: Dec, Year: 1994) <br/> 29-Jul-1955 (Day: 29, Month: Jul, Year: 1955) |
| 1-Jan-1999 is a valid date. <br/> So is 01-July-2000. <br/> I am an awful liar, by the way – Ivo, 28-Sep-2016. | 1-Jan-1999 (Day: 1, Month: Jan, Year: 1999) <br/> 28-Sep-2016 (Day: 28, Month: Sep, Year: 2016) |

## 14.Parse the Employee Data

Write a JS function that **validates employee data** , and stores it **if it is**** valid **. The employee data consists of 3 elements –** employee name **,** employee salary **and** employee position**.

The **input** comes as an array of strings. Each element represents input employee data. You should capture only the valid from them. The input will have the following format:

{employeeName} - {employeeSalary} - {employeePosition}

The **Employee name** will be a **string** , which can contain only **English alphabet letters** and must **start with a capital**. The **Employee salary** should be a **VALID**** number **. The** employee position **can contain** English alphabet letters **,** digits, dashes **,** and can consist of several words **. Any input that** does NOT follow **the specified above rules, is to be treated as** invalid, **and is to** be ignored**.

The **output** should be printed on the console. For every **valid employee data** found, you should print each of its elements. Check the examples.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Isacc - 1000 - CEO <br/> Ivan - 500 - Employee <br/> Peter - 500 - Employee | Name: Isacc <br/> Position: CEO <br/> Salary: 1000 <br/> Name: Ivan <br/> Position: Employee <br/> Salary: 500 <br/> Name: Peter <br/> Position: EmployeeS <br/> alary: 500        |
| Jonathan - 2000 - Manager <br/> Peter- 1000- Chuck <br/> George - 1000 - Team Leader | Name: Jonathan <br/> Position: Manager <br/> Salary: 2000 <br/> Name: George <br/> Position: Team Leader <br/> Salary: 1000 |

### Hints

- Use **Groups** for this problem, it would be a lot easier.

## 15.Form Filler

Write a JS function that automatically fills a form for a lazy client. The client will give you **3 elements** of **data** about himself – his **username** , his **email** , and his **phone number**. After those 3 elements you will be given the form, as text, with several placeholders in it. You must replace each **valid placeholder** with its corresponding value. The placeholders have special symbols and can **contain only English alphabet letters**. There are **3 types** of valid placeholders:

- **&lt;!{letters}!&gt;** - put the given username in place of this
- **&lt;@{letters}@&gt;** - put the given email in place of this
- **&lt;+{letters}+&gt;** - put the given email in place of this

The **input** comes as an array of strings. The **first 3 elements** will represent – the **username** , the **email** and the **phone number**. Each element after that will represent a sentence, if you find a placeholder somewhere in those sentences you should replace it.

The **output** should be printed on the console. The output should consist of all sentences, printed again, this time with their placeholders replaced with the actual data.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Pesho <br/> pesho@softuni.bg<br/> 90-60-90<br/> Hello, &lt;!username!&gt;!<br/> Welcome to your Personal profile.<br/> Here you can modify your profile freely.<br/> Your current username is: &lt;!fdsfs!&gt;. Would you like to change that? (Y/N)<br/> Your current email is: &lt;@DasEmail@&gt;. Would you like to change that? (Y/N)<br/> Your current phone number is: &lt;+number+&gt;. Would you like to change that? (Y/N) | Hello, Pesho! <br/> Welcome to your Personal profile. <br/> Here you can modify your profile freely. <br/> Your current username is: Pesho. Would you like to change that? (Y/N) <br/> Your current email is: pesho@softuni.bg. Would you like to change that? (Y/N) <br/> Your current phone number is: 90-60-90. Would you like to change that? (Y/N) |

## 16.\*Match Multiplication

You are given a text with **numbers** multiplied by **\*** in format **{num1} \* {num2}**. Your job is to extract each two numbers in the above format, multiply them and replace them with their product. The **first number** is integer, can be negative. The **second number** is integer or floating-point and can be negative. There could be whitespace around the &quot; **\***&quot; symbol.

The **input** comes as an array of strings, holding only one element – the text holding the numbers.

The **output** should be printed on the console – it consists of the same text with the multiplied numbers replaced by their product.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| My bill: **2\*2.50** (beer); **2\* 1.20** (kepab); **-2  \* 0.5** (deposit). | My bill: **5** (beer); **2.4** (kepab); **-1** (deposit). |

### Hint

- Match the numbers to be multiplied by regex with groups. Check the overloads for the **String.replace** function, there may be an overload with a **callback** that can help you.
